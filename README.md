# Lesson 1

## How website works + Chrome Dev Tools + Console.log + Comments + Variables

## Homework

1. Create 3 variables (in app.js) - your first name, last name, and your favorite hobby. (this time use const instead of let).
2. Create h1 html tag in index.html and assign "full-name" class to it. And create h2 html tag and assign "favorite-hobby" class to it.
3. In your app.js file write two lines of code where you change h1 and h2 innerHTML with correct info.
   1. h1 tag should be changed using https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/getElementsByClassName
   2. h2 tag should be changed using https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelector
